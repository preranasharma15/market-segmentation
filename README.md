STEP-1: Deciding (not) to Segment:- 
Deciding (not) to segment refers to the process of strategically deciding whether or not to divide a market into segments based on various criteria.
Following are the points to consider before deciding (not) to segment: -
1.	Before deciding to segment, thorough market research is necessary to understand the market.
2.	The decision should align with company’s overall objectives, resources and capabilities.
3.	Consider the long-term implications of segments, including potential market scalability and sustainability of specific segments.
   
STEP-2: Specifying the Ideal Target Segment:- 
Specifying the ideal target segment is a crucial step in development of a project. It involves identifying the most appropriate group of people to target, based on various factors.
Following are the steps for specifying the ideal target segment:
1.	Understand the market: Conduct research to understand the market, identify different customer groups, and their needs. Find out the competitors and learn from their mistakes.
2.	Identify target audience based on age, geography. Gender, Behaviour, Technological preferences, etc
3.	Check whether the product is fit for market.
4.	Analyse whether it is scalable and viable in long run.
5.	Test: Run small-scale marketing campaigns to test responsiveness of the segment. 
6.	Refine and Adapt: Collect feedback and use it to refine the product and adapt according to the market.
   
STEP-3: Collecting Data:- 
Collecting data is the first step in the field of data analysis. The process involves collecting information from different sources to analyse. 
Steps for Data Collection: -
1.	Identify Data Source: Data can be collected from either Primary data source (e.g. Surveys, Interviews, Experiments etc.) or Secondary data sources (e.g. public records, Research papers, Databases etc.)
2.	Ensure Data Quality: Data Quality is measured on the basis of Accuracy, Completeness, Consistency and Reliability.
3.	Collect the data.
4.	Store and organize the data.
5.	 Validate and use the data for analysis.
   
STEP-4: Exploring Data:- 
Exploring data is a crucial step in data analysis, often referred to as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
EDA helps you understand the underlying structure of your data, detect patterns, spot anomalies, and test hypotheses.
Tools commonly used for EDA:
•	Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and SciPy.
•	R: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr.
•	Spreadsheets: Excel or Google Sheets for basic EDA.
•	SQL: Basic SQL queries for exploring structured data stored in databases.

STEP-5: Extracting Segments:- 
Extracting a segment from data usually refers to filtering or selecting a subset of data based on specific criteria. This process is common in data analysis when you want to focus on a particular group or range within a larger dataset.
Common Techniques for Extracting Segments in Data Analysis:
1.	Filtering: Filtering can be done by condition and by time and date.
2.	Clustering: Use clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to segment data into clusters based on similarity in features.
3.	Querying in SQL: Use SQL queries to extract specific segments, such as using SELECT, WHERE, and GROUP BY clauses.
4.	Time Series Segmentation: Segment data based on time intervals, like splitting data into daily, weekly, or monthly segments.
5.	Feature Selection: Extract specific features (columns) from the dataset that are relevant to your analysis.
